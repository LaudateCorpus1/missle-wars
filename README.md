If you want to read the code of this, I recommend ignoring any mcfunction file where the first line starts with "#Generated by: "

the only mcfunction files not titled with this are the ones in the items folder under green and red, and they are fairly simple give commands.

The files you should read to understand how this works are

mw:tick

mw:load

mw:items/give_random_item
